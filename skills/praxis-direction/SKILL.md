description: >
  Sharpen an organizational research agenda into one concrete, resourced bet:
  the organizational outcome it serves, the operational definition of the
  capability with current and target numbers, the intervention and the
  question it answers, the cheapest discriminating test, a compute ladder with
  a spend gate, and the in-house expert and data to use. Reads the
  organization's praxis profile when present. Use when a direction arrives as
  an agenda ("improve X capability", "we should work on Y"), when choosing what
  to work on next inside a company, or when a new system, dataset, or agent
  appears and the question is whether anything there is worth a bet. Output is
  a Goal block for the project's plan. NOT for paper-direction decisions
  (credo-taste), running experiments (credo-experiment), or writing the profile
  (praxis-setup).

# Praxis: Direction

Outcome: the user can state one bet in their own words: the organizational outcome it serves, the number that will move, the intervention, the first cheap test, the resources it may spend, and the observation that ends it. The agent asks one question per turn, uses the organization's profile for what only the organization knows, and stops when the bet is articulated. It does not run experiments, spend money, or hand down a verdict.

## Scope

Use when a research direction is decided inside an organization and the result is a product, customer, or capability decision rather than a paper. A direction usually arrives as an agenda: "improve X capability", "we should look into Y", "the team needs Z". An agenda names an area; a bet names a number, an intervention, and a cost. This skill turns the first into the second.

Do not reopen a settled bet or turn ordinary implementation into an interview. For a paper-direction decision use credo-taste; both have a gate, but they answer to different readers.

## The profile

Read the organization's praxis profile before asking anything it already answers. Resolve it in this order: a path named in the project's `AGENTS.md` or `PROJECT.md`; otherwise `praxis-profile.md` found by walking up from the working directory; otherwise none. State the resolved path once.

Without a profile, run the gate with the generic questions, mark the closing block `profile: none`, and mention praxis-setup once. Do not block on the missing file and do not write a profile from this skill.

The profile is the organization's data. Read it; never edit it here, and never copy its content into an installed skill.

## The gate

Ask in order, one per turn, skipping what the user or the profile has already answered. Stop early when an answer settles the bet.

1. **Outcome.** Which organizational outcome changes if this works: a decision someone makes, a deliverable a customer receives, a claim the company can make? Name the person or the deliverable. If nothing changes, this is an agenda, not a bet; ask what the agenda is standing in for.
2. **Operational definition.** Which task family, measured by which evaluation the organization accepts as evidence, at what number today, and what number would count as success? Until the unit of measurement is fixed, "capability" is not a noun. If the number today is unknown, measuring it is the first bet.
3. **Intervention and the question it answers.** Interventions answer different questions, so they order themselves. Removing a suppression (a refusal direction, a filter, a prompt constraint) answers "is the capability present but held back"; it does not add capability. Training on new data answers "can the capability be added". Prompting and retrieval answer "can the model be told". Ask which question this bet is about, then which cheap test separates the answers before anything expensive runs. Read [references/example.md](references/example.md) for a worked case when the ordering is unclear.
4. **Compute ladder and spend gate.** What can be learned at each tier the profile names, typically always-on resources, one accelerator-day, and a paid burst? Each tier states what it answers and the condition for climbing to the next. Before a paid burst the user writes one sentence predicting the result, and the profile's approval threshold applies. A time estimate alone does not authorize spend.
5. **In-house assets.** Which one question, put to which expert in the profile, would change the plan most? Which internal data applies, and what does its size support: an evaluation set first when the count is small, a few-shot pool next, a training seed only when the count and the license allow it?
6. **Deliverable and kill condition.** What form does the result take, in how many weeks, and what observation ends the bet early?

Stop rules: stop when the user can state the bet; stop after about six questions without convergence and summarize what is and is not settled; if the user answers "I don't know" twice in a row, propose the cheapest measurement that would answer the open question and stop.

No scores or weighted rubrics. If asked for one, give the reasons in prose instead.

## A new system, dataset, or agent appears

When the question is "is there anything here", run the failure-mode pass instead of the gate. Read [references/threat-list.md](references/threat-list.md) for the ten items and the row format, then:

1. Establish what the system is, who controls training, serving, data, and queries, what interfaces are exposed, and which assets matter. Mark unknowns and proceed.
2. Fill one row per item, in order, separating the objective (what fails) from the technique (how) from the access assumed. Prefer the practical variant: is going through the model or data the easiest way to make the bad thing happen? "None known" for prior work means you did not find one.
3. Report at most two leads, each with the observation that makes it practical and the first cheap experiment. If nothing applies, say so in one sentence. Add a disclosure note when a lead is real: patchable by the owner or not.

This is analysis. Do not run attacks, query production systems adversarially, or contact vendors. A lead that survives becomes a bet and goes through the gate.

## Closing

Reflect the answers in one Goal block the user can paste into the project's plan, in their words:

- bet: one sentence
- outcome served: the decision or deliverable, and whose
- measure: evaluation, number today, target
- intervention: what changes and the question it answers
- first test: the cheapest discriminating check and its tier
- ladder: what each tier answers and the climb condition; the spend gate
- assets: the expert question and the data with its supported use
- deliverable and kill condition: form, weeks, ending observation
- prediction: the user's one sentence, dated
- profile: path, or none

When the project uses plan files, the block belongs in the plan's Goal or equivalent section; do not create a second record. Record the prediction where the profile says predictions live. Broader direction changes remain the user's decision.
